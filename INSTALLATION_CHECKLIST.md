## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**ModuleNotFoundError:**
- [ ] Ensure venv is activated (see `(venv)` in prompt)
- [ ] Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

**Model not found:**
- [ ] Check `.env` file `MODEL_PATH` setting
- [ ] Verify file exists: `../../SMART SAFETY PROJECT/TRAINED MODEL RESULT/weights/best.pt`
- [ ] Try absolute path if relative doesn't work

**Port 8000 in use:**
- [ ] Change PORT in `.env` to 8001
- [ ] Update frontend `.env.local` to match

### Frontend Issues

**Module not found:**
- [ ] Run: `npm install` again
- [ ] Delete `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json`
- [ ] Run: `npm install` fresh

**Connection refused:**
- [ ] Ensure backend is running
- [ ] Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `.env.local`
- [ ] Try: http://127.0.0.1:8000 instead of localhost

**Port 3000 in use:**
- [ ] Run: `npm run dev -- -p 3001`
- [ ] Access at: http://localhost:3001

### General Issues

**Cannot login:**
- [ ] Check browser console (F12) for errors
- [ ] Verify backend is running: http://localhost:8000/health
- [ ] Clear browser cache and cookies
- [ ] Try incognito/private window

**Database errors:**
- [ ] Stop backend
- [ ] Delete `ppe_compliance.db` file
- [ ] Restart backend (database will be recreated)

## Final Verification

- [ ] Backend running on port 8000
- [ ] Frontend running on port 3000
- [ ] Can login as admin
- [ ] Can see admin dashboard
- [ ] Can create camera via API
- [ ] Can create user via API
- [ ] Can login as safety manager
- [ ] Can see safety manager dashboard

## Next Steps

Once everything above is checked:

1. **Customize Settings**
   - Change default admin password
   - Update `.env` configuration as needed
   - Add your company logo

2. **Add Cameras**
   - Via API or create UI forms
   - Test with webcam (stream_url: "0")
   - Test with video files

3. **Add Users**
   - Create safety manager accounts
   - Assign appropriate roles

4. **Implement Additional Features**
   - Video monitoring page
   - Camera management UI
   - User management UI
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Report generation

5. **Deploy to Production**
   - Follow deployment guide in README.md
   - Set up Cloudflare Tunnel
   - Deploy frontend to Vercel
